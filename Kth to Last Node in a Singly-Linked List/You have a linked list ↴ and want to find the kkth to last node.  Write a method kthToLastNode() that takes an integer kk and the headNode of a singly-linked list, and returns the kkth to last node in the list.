You have a linked list â†´ and want to find the kkth to last node.

Write a method kthToLastNode() that takes an integer kk and the headNode of a singly-linked list, and returns
the kkth to last node in the list.

It might be tempting to iterate through the list until we reach the end and then walk backward kk nodes.
